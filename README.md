# Statistical-Computing-and-Computation

This is a collection of my work from the course Statistical Computing and Computation. This is a graduate level course offered by Duke's Statistical Science department. The coursework includes two midterm assignments. All work was completed independently. A course description can be found below:

Course Description: Statistical modeling and machine learning involving large data sets and challenging computation. Data pipelines and data bases, big data tools, sequential algorithms and subsampling methods for massive data sets, efficient programming for multi-core and cluster machines, including topics drawn from GPU programming, cloud computing, Map/Reduce and general tools of distributed computing environments.
